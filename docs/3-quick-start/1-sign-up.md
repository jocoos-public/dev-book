# User Registration and Usage Procedure

Currently, FlipFlop Cloud only accepts user registration requests via direct inquiries due to policy constraints. This approach aims to minimize potential misuse of the FlipFlop Cloud service by indiscriminate users, ensuring high-quality service for our customers. It also allows us to prioritize developing the features customers truly need in a stable service environment. However, we are working to establish a system where more people can sign up and experience FlipFlop Cloud without the need for inquiry as quickly as possible.

For now, users can follow the procedure below to register and use FlipFlop Cloud:

1. **User Registration** - Contact us via [support@jocoos.com](mailto:support@jocoos.com) to inquire about registering and using FlipFlop Cloud.
2. **Issuance of a FlipFlop Cloud Sandbox Environment Account**.
3. **Use of FlipFlop Cloud Sandbox Environment and Integration Development**.
4. **Issuance of a FlipFlop Cloud Production Environment Account**.
5. **Use of FlipFlop Cloud Production Environment**.

The issuance of separate accounts for the sandbox and production environments is also designed to ensure the stable operation of the FlipFlop Cloud service. 

The **sandbox environment** is intended for testing purposes and serves as a space where features developed upon customer request are tested before being integrated into the production environment. Commercial use is strictly prohibited in the sandbox environment and is continuously monitored, with potential restrictions enforced if necessary. 

Commercial usage is strictly allowed only in the **production environment**. To maintain stability and security, the sandbox and production environments are entirely separate. Each is an independent service, and accounts are not linked or interoperable between the two environments.
