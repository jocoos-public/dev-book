The Vicollo App Server API is for managing unmanaged Vicollo apps. While managed Vicollo app is a fully managed app where all business logic and member and content management is done by FlipFlop Cloud, unmanaged Vicollo app is for customers that would like to integrate features of Vicollo to their exisisting app or service. Therefore, task of registering members must be done by the app owner.
