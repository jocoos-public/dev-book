# FlipFlop App Client API

The FlipFlop App Client API is designed to allow the client to directly call the FlipFlop App API when all features of FlipFlop Cloud need to be accessed through the backend of a service. This can help reduce the workload on the backend and avoid delays caused by relaying requests through it.

Currently, this API is under development.
