backend of a service. This can help reduce the workload on the backend and avoid delays caused by relaying requests through it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"api-documentation/flipflop-app-server-side-api":{"id":"api-documentation/flipflop-app-server-side-api","title":"FlipFlop App Server API","description":"The FlipFlop App Server API is used when the backend server needs to handle user requests on behalf of the user or when it is necessary to operate services according to business logic using FlipFlop Cloud features.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"api-documentation/vicollo-app-server-side-api":{"id":"api-documentation/vicollo-app-server-side-api","title":"Vicollo App Server API","description":"The Vicollo App Server API is for managing unmanaged Vicollo apps.

Through an App, FlipFlop Cloud separates video-related functionalities for each service, allowing the platform to manage information and provide features independently. FlipFlop Cloud offers various types of apps, allowing users to select the most suitable one based on how and in what environment they intend to use video features.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"key-concepts/members":{"id":"key-concepts/members","title":"Member","description":"A member refers to a user belonging to an app in FlipFlop Cloud. All video-related features in FlipFlop Cloud are designed to be used through members. Therefore, if you want to provide video features to users of a concrete service via FlipFlop Cloud, you need to register the users of your service as members within the App. The minimum required information for registration is the user ID from the actual service. Once a member is registered to an App, their actual service ID is stored and managed as a string attribute called appUserId. Although an internal, separate ID is generated, all member activities are designed to be tracked based on appUserId for the convenience of developers using FlipFlop Cloud.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"key-concepts/transcoding-profiles":{"id":"key-concepts/transcoding-profiles","title":"Transcoding Profile","description":"Usage of Transcoding Profiles","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"key-concepts/video-posts":{"id":"key-concepts/video-posts","title":"Video Post","description":"A Video Post is a unit used to manage videos in the form of posts, allowing users to share video content. When viewing shared videos, they need to be viewed in a compressed format to save network bandwidth, which requires a transcoding process. Therefore, even if the purpose is not to share the video but rather to transcode it, a Video Post should be used.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"key-concepts/video-rooms":{"id":"key-concepts/video-rooms","title":"Video Room","description":"A Video Room allows people to communicate and interact in real-time using video as a medium.
