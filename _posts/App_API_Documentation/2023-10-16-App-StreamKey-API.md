# Introduction

This document introduces the StreamKey-related App API that can be call on the server-side.

# API

<a name="Force-Terminate-StreamKey"></a>
## Force Terminate StreamKey

---

  * Forcefully terminates the ongoing RTMP ingestion of a specific StreamKey. (ex: when streaming harmful content)
  * Upon successful response, streamKeyState is updated to `INACTIVE` and the streamKey value is reissued. If there is a VideoRoom being broadcast, videoRoomState is updated to `ENDED` and the VOD result is not saved.
  * If StreamKey is not in the process of RTMP ingestion, it responds with a success response without a separate error response and does not take any action.

```
curl -i -X POST \
   -H "Authorization:Basic {base64of({appApiKey}:{appApiSecret})}" \
 '{api-base-url}/v2/apps/stream-keys/{streamKey.id}/force-terminate'

# 204 No Content
