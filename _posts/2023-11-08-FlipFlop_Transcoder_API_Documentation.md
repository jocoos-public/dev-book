# Introduction
This document defines how to use the flip-flop transcoder. Transcoding can be done in two ways. You can upload and transcode from the dashboard, or you can transcode via the API. First, sign up for the dashboard and create an application. Use this application's App Key and App Secret to use the platform API.

The following information is required to use the transcoder
- email: The email of the account that signed up for the dashboard
- password: The password of the account that signed up for the dashboard
- app key: The application's key
- app secret: The application's secret key

# How to create a Application
1. Sign up for a dashboard. You'll need an email and password.
2. Log in to your dashboard.
3. Create an application in the dashboard.
4. Find your app key and app secret on your application's settings page.
5. Use the API with your app key and app secret key.


# Transcoding using the dashboard
You can try transcoding and see the results in the dashboard. You'll need to sign up or have an email/password forwarded to you to use the dashboard.


## How to Transcoding
- Access your dashboard at https://dashboard.flipflop.tv/.
- Sign in with your email and password.
- Select Demo from the Applications list. 
- On the Videos -> Videos page, click Upload in the top right corner. 
- In the new window that opens, use the + button to upload your file. You do not need to enter a title and description.
- Upload your video information and file.
- When the transcoding is finished, your video will appear in the list and you can click on it.
- Check the result in the new window.


# Transcoding using the API
To use the API, you need an AccessToken. There are two types of Access Tokens. There are two types of access tokens: Admin Token and User Token.

| Type | Required | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin Token | email, password | Permissions for all videos in the application |
| User Token | App Key, App Secret, User ID | Permissions for your own videos |


## API Host

| Name | URL |
| --- | --- |
| API Host | https://www.flipflop.tv |

## API Concept
- Authentication uses the Authorization in the header.
- All responses are responded to as Json.


## Authentication Tokens
### Admin Token
Get an admin token. Email, password are required.

### Http Request
```
POST {{host}}/oauth/token
```

### Request Header

| Key | Requried | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization | true | Basic Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3RzZWNyZXQ= |
| Content-Type | true | application/x-www-form-urlencoded |

### Request body 

| Key | Requried | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| grant_type | true | String | client_credentails |
| email | true | String | Email for the account you use in the dashboard |
| secret | true | String | The password for the account you use in the dashboard |

### Repsone body 

| Key | Requried | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| access_token | string | Access Token |
| token_type | string | Token type ex) bearer |
| expires_in | number | Token validity, returned in seconds |
| scope | number | Token scope |
| member_id | string | Admin ID |
| jti | string | JWT ID |

### Reqeust Example
```
curl guest:guestsecrest@${{host}}/oauth/token -d grant_type=client_credentials -d  email=sample@email.com -d secret=smaple_password
```

### Response Example
```
{
  "access_token" : "eyJhbGc...",
  "token_type" : "bearer",
  "expires_in" : 2591999,
  "scope" : "guest",
  "member_id" : "1",
  "jti" : "19043fa1-c1e2-4e3d-a292-2378e801619c"
}
```

## User Token
Get a user token. You'll need an app_key, app_secret, and user_id.
You can find the app_key and app_secret when you create an application in the dashboard and on the Settings page.
Alternatively, you can use the app_key and app_secret that are passed to you. The user token is a Basic token, which uses the base64-encoded value of app_key, app_secret.

```
sample_app_key:sample_app_secret -> c2FtcGxlX2FwcF9rZXk6c2FtcGxlX2FwcF9zZWNyZXQ=
```
### Http Request

## Video Upoad And Transcoding
After the upload is complete, the transcoding request will be processed internally. Once the video has been transcoded, it will pass the address of the video as the callback URL.

### Http Request
```
POST  {{host}}/v2/admin/applications/{appKey}/uploads
```
### Path Variables

## Get a list of videos
View the list of videos. Not all videos are visible in the video list. Videos that have been deleted or have failed to transcode will not be visible. To get a list of videos that are being transcoded, use state in the request parameter with a value of `VOD_TRANS`. To get a list of deleted videos, use `DELETED`.
In video search, the start date (from) and end date (to) are based on the video registration date. The time of the start and end date is used internally as 0:00 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds. The start date, end date, and title can be used together, but only one of each can be requested alone.
